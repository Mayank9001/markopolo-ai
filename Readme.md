## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS
- **Table Engine**: `@tanstack/react-table`
- **Virtualization**: `@tanstack/react-virtual`
- **Backend**: Mocked user API (can integrate any paginated backend)
- **State & Fetching**: React hooks

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Server will run at `PORT=3000`.
- Test API calls accordingly for error handling and success (e.g., `/api/users?page=2&limit=100`, `/api/users?page=-10&limit=100`).
- Change `page`, `limit` (per page) as per need in `usePaginatedUsers.js` in frontend directory.

### 🎨 Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

App will run on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite default).

## 🧠 Architecture & Optimization

### Virtual Scrolling

- Integrated `@tanstack/react-virtual` to render only visible rows.
- Improves performance when dealing with thousands of rows.

### Controlled Sorting

- Sorting is handled via `@tanstack/react-table` using controlled state.
- Visual indicators (`▲▼`) show current sort direction.

### Debounced Search

- Search input is manually debounced using `setTimeout`.
- Prevents excessive API requests on every keystroke.

### Lazy Pagination

- As the user scrolls, new pages are fetched and appended.
- Triggered 300px before bottom using scroll listener + debounce.

### Defensive Programming

- Handles missing or malformed data (e.g., null phone or missing address).
- Uses optional chaining to prevent crashes.

## 🏆 Bonus Features

- ✨ Sorting arrows (`▲▼`) always visible and toggle visually on click.
- 🎯 Search bar aligns right and is styled for clarity and focus.
- 💼 Company and city shown together in a custom-computed column.
- 🧪 Handles edge cases like:
  - API failure
  - Empty search results
  - Rapid input typing
